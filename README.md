# Ticketing Project

Ticketing Project is a simple ticketing web application. It demonstrates populating and accessing an Oracle XE database.

# Run
Run the SQL script named ticketDBScript using SQL Developer or Docker and connect to Oracle DB using Docker. 
Using Intellij, connect to the Database. 
Then download the project from github. MyWebApplication2 is the root directory. Run on an IDE (we used Intellij). 
Then run project MyWebApplication2 in Intellij and run on your browser localhost:8080 to access the app. 


# Demo
Demo (databaseDemo.v3.mp4):
At the home page, you can type in the choice of venue, the date, and number of tickets you would like to buy to explore availability of certain events. Log in or sign up to make a user account and it will lead you to screen with choices of venue, performers, and ticket prices. Upon clicking on the venue name, it will give you venue information. Another button on this screen will lead you to performer information. Clicking on a button at the top right will lead you to your profile, where you can see your friends, bought tickets and details, and your profile page with a picture and account information.
